## conjunctions to improve flow
![[Pasted image 20231030234656.png]]
- problem 1: Using conjunctions at the beginning of a sentence.
![[Pasted image 20231030234825.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231030234841.png]]
- problem 2: using 'and' to connect  unrelated facts
## using repeats to improve flow
- Repeat of words is NOT a problem in academic writing
- to the contrary, repeats improve clarity and precision
## time adverbials to improve flow
first, then, lastly, finally ...
## -ing clauses to improve flow
- emphasize cause and effect
- used in combination with 'thus' (optional)
- render your statement more dynamic
- very common in academic writing

- problem of ==ambiguity== when used >2 times in one sentence.
## summary words to improve flow
- This/These + summary word
- Caution: 'this' sometimes used 'unsupported' by noun.

## peer review 
We have shown that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens. **These changes are** consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs.

**It was observed that** femur in experimental animals was 40% more vertical than control subjects, thus demonstrating the posterior displacement of the CoM produced a more vertically oriented femur during standing.

**In addition,** it increased femoral retraction and decreased knee flexion during walking.

These indicate a shift **from the standard knee-driven bipedal locomotion birds** to a more hip-driven locomotion, **which** is typical of crocodilians (the only other extant archosaur group), mammals, hypothetically, and bipedal non-avian dinosaurs.

**In combination with our data, it becomes evident that** for a given CFL mass, femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures.

Aiming to test if the postural differences observed in this study produced changes in limb morphology, we **subsequently**  measured the length and mid-shaft cross-sectional properties of the femur in all our individuals.

**Despite our observations**, we found no differences in cross-sectional femoral geometry among groups.

**Notably**, femur length tended to be greater in the experimental group than in both the control-weight and the control group (by 4 and 7%, respectively), although not significant.

It has even been proposed that, due to functional convergence, mammals might be a better system to study bipedal dinosaur locomotion. **However**, the results reported here show that important aspects of non-avian theropod locomotion can be experimentally recreated in modern birds.

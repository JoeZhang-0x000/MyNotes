## Results Analysis
Based on comprehensive analysis, the experiment results show R2 scores ranging from 0.87 to 0.94, indicating a good model fit. However, as the iteration number increases, the training time also increases. In summary, increasing the iteration number improves model performance at the cost of longer training time. Therefore, a trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency should be considered in practical applications. These findings provide valuable insights for future research and applications.

## Theoretical Foundation
Our research focuses on investigating the lid-driven cavity flow as the chosen subject.
The loss function for this problem is given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathcal L = t\cdot(\mathcal L_{f}+ \mathcal L_{b})+(1-t)\cdot\mathcal L_{h} 
& 0 \le t \le 1
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, $\mathcal L_h$ represents the auxiliary data, which could be a *circular vector field*.
We will use point vortices and the velocity field of low Reynolds number *LDC* flow  as the auxiliary vector fields for training.
here would be the point vortices vector fields be like:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Psi = k\frac{\Gamma}{\ln r}
\end{aligned}
$$
and the shortcut of these vector fields could be like the follow:

In order to demonstrate proposed method is more advanced, it is essential to demonstrate faster **convergence** and higher **precision** compared to original method.
Convergence and precision can be demonstrated by loss function or R2 score curves.
## Experiment Setup
### Discretization
Firstly a crucial question is how to implement the continuation. As in a NN, $t$ in the loss function can only take discrete values. Therefore, it is imperative to select an appropriate discretization scheme of $t$.
Here I have devised the following potential solutions:
*linear discretization*
In Linear Discretization, the range between 0 and 1 is uniformly divided into discrete intervals. These intervals serve as discrete values for the parameter t, which are subsequently used during the training of NN.
*exponential and logarithmic discretization*
Exponential(or logarithmic) discretization, as the name implies, refers to the non-uniform discretization of the interval between 0 and 1. In this approach, the intervals become progressively smaller as $t$ approaches 1, allowing for finer granularity in the region.
### Parameters Setting
#### Linear Discretization
$$
y = \frac{x - \text{{start}}}{\text{{end}} - \text{{start}}}
$$
and the function would be shown in the below:

#### Exponential Discretization
$$
y = \left(\frac{x}{\text{{end}}}\right)^2
$$
and the function image are shown as below:

#### Logarithmic Discretization 
$$
y = -\log\left(1 - \frac{x}{\text{{end}}}\right)
$$

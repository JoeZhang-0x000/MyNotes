## Experiment Setup
![[Pasted image 20230703191904.png#C|运行参数设置2-固定sub_num]]
Based on the previous experiment, where the segment was held constant while varying the total iteration number, we observed an improvement in accuracy as the iteration number increased. In this new experiment, we will keep the segment iterations fixed while manipulating the total iteration number. This will allow us to study the impact of the overall iteration count on the accuracy of the results.

## Results Analysis
When segment iteration is fixed,
1. Increasing segment numbers leads to longer training times, which is expected as more iterations require more computation.
2. The R2 score metric, which measures the prediction accuracy of neural networks, remained relatively constant across different experiments.
3. The experiment with the total iteration number of 100k and 100 segments showed a significantly lower R2 score of 0.10, which suggests potential issues or challenges associated with very high iteration numbers or segment counts.
Overall, in this experiment, the segment iterations were held constant, while the total iterations were varied. The results suggest that the variations in total iteration numbers did not have a substantial impact on the R2 score. Meanwhile, it would be valuable to further investigate the causes of lower R2 score observed in the experiment with 100k total iterations and 100 segment counts.

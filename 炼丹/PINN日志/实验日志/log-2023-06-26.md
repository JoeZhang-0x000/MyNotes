# Experiment 1-The Potential Influence of the Test point Density
## Experiment Setup
The experiment serves as an extension of the previous study, aiming to explore the potential influence of test point density on R2 scores. In the pervious experiment, a $10\times10$ grid of points were employed to evaluate the R2 scores. In the current experiment, the density has been increased to a $50 \times 50$ grid.
## Experiment Result
Re = 100
auxiliary data Re = 10

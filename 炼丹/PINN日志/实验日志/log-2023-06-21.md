# Initial Implementation of Homotopy Continuation Method
## Implementation Details 
### New Kind of Constrain
I have introduced a new constrain called `data loss` in `pde\pde.py`  file, and an example code demonstrating its usage can be found in `cavity/src/homotopy.py`. This new constrain is similar to the loss function used commonly in machine learning, as it measures the L2 distance between the output of NN and the ground truth. Furthermore, the new constrain has the following arguments:
```
{

	'type':'data loss', # 数据约束给定一个数据集，进行约束

	'domain':X, # 受到约束的点云也在数据集中存储,np.ndarray

	'obj':[0,1], # 受到约束的是NN输出的第几列

	'value':Y, # 数据集，目前只支持np.ndarray

}
```

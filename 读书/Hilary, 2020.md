## Language and Writing Skills
### Verb tense choices

因此研究都发生在过去了，你写这篇文章时候研究应该已经做完了，所以常用的是past simple, present simple, and present prefect.
时态的选择并无限制，其主要目的是使得你的文章reader-firendly，即尽量减少歧义和阅读障碍。
#### Past simple vs present simple
简单的说，两者的强调内容不同。
- 一般现在时，强调这件事已经成为一种公知或者已经被证明了；
- 一般过去时，只强调这件事就发生过；
例如，
```
They found that the pressure increased as the temperature rose.
They found that the pressure increases as the temperature rises. 
```
前者只是说他们发现了压力随着温度升高而增大(可能只是在某次实验中这样，并没有被证明具有普适性)，后者则是暗含，经过了大量的实验，他们发现了一个普遍的规律，即压力随着温度升高而增大，并且这种规律可能已经被广泛的认可了。
#### Past simple vs present perfect
一般过去时和现在完成时的主要区别是：
- 一般过去时，这件事情发生过；
- 现在完成时，这件事情发生过，并且影响可能持续到现在，更加强调影响；
例如，
```
Little attention has been paid to the selection of an alternative biocompatible material.
```
这里使用现在完成时，当时(几年前)很少有人注意到xxx，并且直到现在还没有解决这个问题，暗指了本文作者要研究xxx。
```
Little attention was paid to the selection of an alternative biocompatible material.
```
这里使用一般过去时，表明当时(几年前)很少有人注意到xxx，但是可能从那时起，人们就开始关注这个问题了，甚至于可能现在已经有人解决了这个问题。

#### Notices
`Tense changes are always meaningful, and always signal a chance in the function of the information, so DON'T choose or change tense randomly.`

需要根据领域内最近的已经发表的期刊，模仿他们的叙述方式；如果你是该领域大佬的话，那你不需要模仿，因为其他人会模仿你。
### Linking sentence
`The gap between sentences is a dangerous space.`
`Your job as a writer is to close the gap as tightly as possible, so that readers can effortlessly connect one piece of informantion to the next.`
很多时候读者是没有那么充沛的时间去仔细的研读我们的文章的，尤其是审稿人，因此我们需要做到的就是尽量不要让他们产生阅读障碍。作为一个作者，我们对于某个小方向可能是专家，但是我们的读者可能并不是，他是难以跟上我们的节奏的。所以我们务必要把握好文章的句子与句子之间的关联，段落与段落之间的承接。

原文作者在这里给出了四种方式去连接上下文：
#### Overlap and Repeat
重复，重复，重复。
重复上文提到的名词，术语。
#### Pro-form
使用代词，例如 the system, these methods ...
However, 使用代词时候需要慎重，因为指代本身就可能造成confusion.
例如，
```
This result was statistically significant and is in line with results in previous studies. This suggests that… 
```
这里的This就产生了歧义，到底是指代this result was statistically significant 还是 this result is in line with results in previous studies? 或者，还是两者都指代了？
#### Semicolon
使用分号，当两个句子的关系比较接近时，使用分号连接，不要用句号，这样读者就会很清晰的明白这两个句子的关系。用逗号也能达到相似的效果，但是可能会让句子显得特别长。分号十分优雅。
#### Signal
使用信号词，例如therefore, consequently ...
这些信号词是读者在阅读文章时可能会比较容易关注到的，也是一种提示，接下来的内容才是关键。
但是也不要overuse signal, 因为这样会让整个文章显得很笨重，过分强调。读者也可能因此而难以把握文章的重点。因为通篇都是转折转折，读者一下子就可能晕了。
##### 常见信号词整理
- 表原因
	- due to
	- on account of
	- in view of 
	- as/because/since
- 表结果
	- therefore
	- hence
	- thus
	- consequently
	- as a result
	- so
- 表差异
	- however
	- whereas
	- but
	- on the other hand
	- while
	- by contrast
	- in contrast
- 表意外
	- although
	- even though
	- though
	- despite
	- in spite of
	- regardless of
	- notwithstanding
	- nevertheless
	- however
	- yet
	- but
	- nonetheless
	- even so
- 表补充
	- in addition
	- moreover
	- furthermore
	- also
	- secondly/in the second place
	- what is more
- 表转折
	- with regard to
	- as to
	- regarding
	- with respect to
	- as for
	- turning now to
### Passive and Active choices
``Science writing has traditionally favoured the passive, perhaps because it seems more objective, but this is changing in some fields and in some journals.``
一般来说，尽量使用非人的主格，例如This paper is organized... , It is known that... .这样显得客观一些。

### Paragraphing
``Good paragraphing is key to text planning, and good text planning is essential for fast, effective text production.``

``The other sentences (follow the center sentence) then discuss that topic, describe it, define it in more detail, develop it, give examples of it, rephrase it, explain it, etc. ``

读者很多时候阅读文章是跳读的，这时候他们会比较关注段落的第一句话，通常来说就是段落的中心句。余下的内容应当是对中心句的修饰，补充，说明。

一个好的段落不应该过长或者过短。过长可能是因为你在一个段落中涵盖了太多的观点，应该拆分成多个段落；过短可能是因为你的段落中只是在报菜名，并没有展开讲。这两种情况都会导致not reader-friendly and confusing.

一般而言，一篇学术论文的摘要部分的每一段大概是150-170单词。很少有超过230个或者低于80个的。关于每一段应该写多少单词，具体还是要follow your target journal.

原文的作者给出了一下的一些方法去完成摘要的分段
- List each topic/concept/idea that you want to discuss and then order them logically for the reader.
- List the bullet points you want to include for each topic, and then order the bullet points logically for the reader.
- Consider how many paragraphs you will need for each topic.
- Check that each paragraph has a function within that topic, for example to provide factual background/describe the advantage or disadvantage of a method/present an existing theory/explain why you agree with something/provide a detailed example/compare different techniques.
- Make sure that the function of the paragraph is clear to the reader.
- Consider using a statement of intent at the beginning of the paragraph to present the focus or topic of the paragraph and/or link it with the previous paragraph. 

以下是一些可能会用到的链接段落之间关系的句式：

|              |                 |
|--------------|-----------------|
| According to this theory, … | An alternative approach is… |
| Another key feature is… | Having collected the data, … |
| Here, we present… | In order to explore this, … |
| On the basis of this finding, … | Our next goal was… |
| The first evidence for this is… | These data suggest that… |
| This is important because… | This process occurs in two stages. |
| To address this question, … | To confirm…, we… |
| Turning now to… | We argue that… |
| When we consider… | With regard to… |

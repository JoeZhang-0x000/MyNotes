## 概括

## 收获
1. Introduction部分引用了许多PINN在各行各业的应用，可以参考。
2. Recent researches of fully-connected neural networks demonstrated that it suffers from **spectral bias** and incapable of learning functions with high frequencies, both in theory and practice.
3. The convergence rate of the total training error can be evaluated by the spectrum of its NTK at initialization.
